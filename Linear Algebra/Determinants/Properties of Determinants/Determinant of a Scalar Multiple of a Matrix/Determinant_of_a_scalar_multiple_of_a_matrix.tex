{\bf Theorem: Determinant of a Scaral Multiple Matrix}
\vskip 1mm

\vskip 6pt
If $A$ is a square martrix of order $n$ and $c$ is a scalar, then the determinant of $cA$ is

$$det(cA)=c^ndet(A)$$

\vskip 10pt
{\bf Proof}

\vskip 6pt
This formula can be proven by repeated applications of Property 3 of Theorem Elementary Row Operations and Determinants. Factor the scalar $c$ out of each of the $n$ rows of $|cA|$ to obtain $|cA|=c^n|A|$.
