{\bf Conditions That Yield a Zero Determinant}
\vskip 1mm
\hrule

\vskip 6pt
If $A$ is a square matrix and any one of the conditions below is true, then $det(A)=0$.

\vskip 6pt
(1) An entire row (or an entire coluumn) consists of zeros.

\vskip 6pt
(2) Two rows (or columns) are equal.

\vskip 6pt
(3) One row (or column) is a multiple of another row (or column).

\vskip 10pt
{\bf Proof}

\vskip 6pt
If an entire row or column consists of zeros, then each cofactor in the expansion is multiplied by zero. When condition 2 or 3 is true, use elementary row or column  operations to create row or column of zeros.
