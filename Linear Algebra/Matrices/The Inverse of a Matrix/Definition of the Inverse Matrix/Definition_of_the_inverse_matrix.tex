An $n\times n$ matrix $A$ is {\bf invertible} (or {\bf nonsingular}) when there exits an $n\times n$ matrix $B$ such that

$$AB=BA=I_n$$

where $I_n$ is the identity matrix of order $n$. The matrix $B$ is the (multiplicative) {\bf inverse} of $A$. A matrix that does not have an inverse is {\bf noninvertible} (or {\bf singular}).
