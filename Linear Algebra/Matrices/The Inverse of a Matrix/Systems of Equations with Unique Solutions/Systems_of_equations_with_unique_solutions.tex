{\bf Theorem: Systems of Equations with Unique Solutions}

\vskip 6pt
If $A$ is an invertible matrix, then the system of linear equations $Ax=b$ has a unique solution $x=A^{-1}b$.

\vskip 10pt
{\bf Proof}

\vskip 6pt
The matrix $A$ is nonsingular, so the steps shown are valid.

$$\eqalign{Ax&=b\cr
	A^{-1}Ax&= A^{-1}b\cr
	Ix&=A^{-1}b\cr
	x&=A^{-1}b}$$

This solution is unique because if $x_1$ and $x_2$ were two solutions, then you could apply the cancellation property to the equation $Ax_1=b=Ax_2$ to conclude that $x_1=x_2$
