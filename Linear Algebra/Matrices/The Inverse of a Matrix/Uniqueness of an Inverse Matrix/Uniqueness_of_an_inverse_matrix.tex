{\bf Uniqueness of an Inverse Matrix}

\vskip 6pt
If $A$ is an invertible matrix, then its inverse is unique. The inverse of $A$ is denoted by $A^{-1}$.

{\bf Proof}

\vskip 6pt
If $A$ is invertible, then it has at least one inverse $B$ such that

$$AB=I=BA$$

Assume that $A$ has another inverse $C$ such that

$$AC=I=CA$$

Demonstrate that $B$ and $C$ are equal.

$$\eqalign{AB&=I\cr
	C(AB)&=CI\cr
	(CA)B&=C\cr
	IB&=C\cr
	B&=C\cr}$$

Consequently $B=C$ and it follows that the inverse of a matrix is unique.
