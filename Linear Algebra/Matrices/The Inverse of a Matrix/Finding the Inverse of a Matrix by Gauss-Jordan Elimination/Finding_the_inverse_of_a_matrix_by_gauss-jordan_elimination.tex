Let $A$ be a square matrix of order $n$.

\vskip 6pt
{\bf (1)} Write the $n\times 2n$ matrix that consists of $A$ on the left and the $n\times n$ identity matrix $I$ on the right to obtain $\bigl\lbrack A\quad I\bigr\rbrack$. This process is called {\bf adjoining} matrix $I$ to matrix $A$.

\vskip 6pt
{\bf (2)} If possible, row reduce $A$ to $I$ using elementary row operations on the entire matrix $\bigl\lbrack A\quad I\bigr\rbrack$. The result will be the matrix $\bigl\lbrack I\quad A^{-1}\bigr\rbrack$. If this is not possible, then $A$ is noninvertible (or singular).

\vskip 6pt
{\bf (3)} Check your work by multiplying to see that $AA^{-1}=I=A^{-1}A$.
