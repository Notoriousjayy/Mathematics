If $A,B$ and $C$ are matrices (with sizes such that matrix produts are defined), and $c$ is scalar, then the properties below are true.

\vskip 10pt
1. $A(BC)=(AB)C$\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad Associative Property of Multiplication

\vskip 6pt
2. $A(B+C)=AB+AC$\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad$\,$ Distributive Property

\vskip 6pt
3. $(A+B)C=AB+AC$\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad Distributive Property

\vskip 6pt
4. $c(AB)=(cA)B=A(cB)$

{\bf Proof}

\vskip 6pt
To prove property 2, show that corresponding entries of matrices $A(B+C)$ and $AB+AC$ are equal. Assume $A$ has size $m\times n$, $B$ has size $n\times p$, and $C$ has size $n\times p$. Using the definition of matrix multiplication, the entry in the $i^{th}$ row and $j^{th}$ column of $A(B+C)$ is $a_{i1}(b_{1j}+c_{1j})+a_{i2}(b_{2j}+c_{2j})+\cdots+a_{in}(b_{nj}+c_{nj})$. Moreover, the entry in the $i^{th}$ row and $j^{th}$ column of $AB+AC$ is

$$(a_{i1}b_{1j}+a_{i2}b_{2j}+\cdots+a_{in}b_{nj})+(a_{i1}c_{1j}+a_{i2}c_{2j}+\cdots+a_{in}c_{nj})$$

By distributing and regrouping, you can see that these two $ij^{th}$ entries are equal. So,

$$A(B+C)=AB+AC$$
