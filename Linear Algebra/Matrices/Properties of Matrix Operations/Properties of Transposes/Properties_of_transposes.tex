\vskip 6pt
If $A$ and $B$ are matrices (with sizes such that the matrix operations are defined) and $c$ is a scalar, then the properties below are true.

\vskip 10pt
1. $(A^T)^T=A$\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad Transpose of a transpose

\vskip 6pt
2. $(A+B)^T=A^T+B^T$\quad\quad\quad Transpose of a sum

\vskip 6pt
3. $(cA)^T=c(A^T)$\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad Transpose of a scalar multiple

\vskip 6pt
4. $(AB)^T=B^TA^T$\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad Transpose of a product

{\bf Proof}

\vskip 6pt
The transpose operation interchanges rows and columns. To prove Property 1, let $A$ be an $m\times n$ matrix. Observe that $A^T$ has size $n\times m$ abd $(A^T)^T$ has size $m\times n$, the same as $A$. To show that $(A^T)^T=A$, you must show that the $ij^{th}$ entries are the same. Let $a_{ij}$ be the $ij^{th}$ entry of $A$. Then $a_{ij}$ is the $ji^{th}$ entry of $A^T$, and the $ij^{th}$ entry of $(A^T)^T$.This proves Property 1.
