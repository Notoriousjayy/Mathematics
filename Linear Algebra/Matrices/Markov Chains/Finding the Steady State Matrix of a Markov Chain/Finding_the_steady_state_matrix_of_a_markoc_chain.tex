(1) Check to see that the matrix of transition probabilities $P$ is a regular matrix.

\vskip 6pt
(2) Solve the system of linear equations obtained from the matrix equation $P\bar{X}=\bar{X}$ along with the equation $x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n=1$.

(3) Check the solution found in Step 2 in the matrix equation $P\overline{X}=\overline{X}$.
