Let $P(n)$ be a property that is defined for integers $n$, and let $a$ and $b$ be fixed integers with $a\leq b$. Suppose the following two statements are true:

\vskip 3mm
$1.$ $P(a),P(a+1),\ldots ,$ and $P(b)$ are all true. {(basis step)}

\vskip 1mm
$2.$ For any integer $k\geq b$, if $P(i)$ is true for all integers $i$ from $a$ through $k$, then $P(k+1)$ is true. {\bf (inductive step)}

\vskip 1mm
Then the statement

\vskip 1mm
\centerline{for all integers $n\geq a, P(n)$}

\vskip 1mm
is true. (The supposition that $P(i)$ is true for all integrs $i$ through $k$ is called the {\bf inductive hypothesis}. Another way to state the inductive hypothesis is to say that $P(a),P(a+1),\ldots , P(k)$ are all true.)
