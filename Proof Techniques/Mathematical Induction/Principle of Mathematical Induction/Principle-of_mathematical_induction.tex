Let $P(n)$ be a property that is deined for integers $n$ and let $a$ be a fixed integer. Suppose the following two statements are true:

\vskip 1mm
$1.$ $P(a)$ is true

\vskip 1mm
$2.$ For all integers $k\geq a$, if $P(k)$ is true then $P(k+1)$ is true. The the statement $$\qquad\hbox{for all integers $n \geq a, P(n)$}$$ is true.

{\bf Method of Proof by Mathematical Induction}

\vskip 6pt
Consider a statement of the form, "For all integers $n\geq a$, a property $P(n)$ is true." To prove such a statement, perform the following steps.

\vskip 1mm
{\bf Step 1 (basis step):} Show that $P(a)$ is true.

\vskip 1pc
{\bf Step 2 (inductive step):} Show that for all integers $k\geq a$, if $P(k)$ is true then $P(k+1)$ is true. To perform this step,

\vskip 1mm
\centerline{{\bf suppose} that $P(k)$ is true, where $k$ is any particular but arbitrarily chosen integer with $k\geq a$}

\vskip 1mm
\centerline{[This supposition is called the {\bf inductive hypothesis.}]}

\vskip 1mm
Then

\vskip 1mm
{\bf show} that $P(k+1)$ is true.
