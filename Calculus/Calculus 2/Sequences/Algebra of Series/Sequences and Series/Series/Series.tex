{\bf Series}
\vskip 6pt

Given the infinite sequence

$$a_1,a_2,a_3, \ldots a_n, \ldots ,$$

the sum of the terms

$$a_1+a_2+a_3+ \ldots a_n+ \ldots +$$

is called an {\bf infinite series}. A {\bf partial sum} is the sum of the first $n$ terms:

$$a_1+a_2+a_3+ \ldots a_n$$

A partial sum is also called a {\bf finite series}, or {\bf $n^{th}$ partial sum}, and is denoted $S_n$
