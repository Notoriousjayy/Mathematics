A {\bf sequence} is a function whose domain is either all the integers between two given integers or all the integers greater than or equal to a given integer.

An {\bf infinite sequence} is a function having for its domain the set of positive integers $\lbrace 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\rbrace$

If $m$ and $n$ are integers and $m\leq n$, the symbol $\sum^n_{k=m}a_k$, read the {\bf summation from $k$ equals $m$ to $n$ of $a$-sub-$k$}, is the sum of all the terms $a_m,a_{m+1}, a_{m+2},\ldots, a_n$. We say that $a_m+a_{m+1}+a_{m+2}+\ldots +a_n$ is the {\bf expanded form} of the sum, and we write $$\sum^n_{k=m}a_k=a_m+a_{m+1}+a_{m+2}+\ldots +a_n$$ We call $k$ the {\bf index} of the summation, $m$ the {\bf lower limit} of the summation, and $n$ the {\bf upper limit} of the summation.

If $m$ and $n$ are integers and $m\leq n$, the symbol $\prod^n_{k=m}a_k$, read the {\bf product from $k$ equals $m$ to $n$ of $a$-sub-$k$}, is the product of all the terms $a_m,a_{m+1}, a_{m+2},\ldots, a_n$. We write $$\prod^n_{k=m}a_k=a_m\cdot a_{m+1}\cdot a_{m+2}\cdot \cdots \cdot a_n$$ We call $k$ the {\bf index} of the product, $m$ the {\bf lower limit} of the product, and $n$ the {\bf upper limit} of the product.

If $a_m+a_{m+1}+a_{m+2}+\ldots$ and $b_m+b_{m+1}+b_{m+2}+\ldots$ are sequences of real numbers and $c$ is any real number, then the following equations hold for any integer $m\leq n$

$$\sum^n_{k=m}a_k+\sum^n_{k=m}b_k=\sum^n_{k=m}(a_k+b_k)$$

$$c \cdot \sum^n_{k=m}a_k= \sum^n_{k=m}c\cdot a_k \qquad\hbox{generalized distribution law}\qquad$$

$$\Biggl(\prod^n_{k=m}a_k\Biggr)\cdot \Biggl(\prod^n_{k=m}b_k\Biggr)=\prod^n_{k=m}(a_k\cdot b_k)$$
