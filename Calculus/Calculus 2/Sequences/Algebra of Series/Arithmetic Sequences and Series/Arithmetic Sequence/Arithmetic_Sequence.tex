{\bf Arithmetic Sequences}
\vskip 6pt

A sequence is {\bf arithmetic} if there exists a number $d$, called the {\bf common difference}, such that 
\vskip 0.5mm
$a_{n+1}=a_n+d$ for any integer $n\geq 1$.

\vskip 2cm
A sequence $a_0,a_1,a_2,\ldots$ is called an {\bf arithmetic sequence} if, and only if, there is a constant $d$ such that

$$a_k=a_{k-1}+d \quad\hbox{for all integers $k\geq 1$}$$

\vskip 1mm
It follows that,

$$a_n=a_0+dn \quad\hbox{for all integers $n\geq 0$}$$
