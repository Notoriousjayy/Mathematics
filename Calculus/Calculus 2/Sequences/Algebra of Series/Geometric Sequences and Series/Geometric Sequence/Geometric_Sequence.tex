{\bf Geometric Sequence}
\vskip 6pt

A sequence is {\bf geometric if there is a number $r$, called the {\bf common raio}, such that}

$${a_{n+1}\over a_n}=r \quad\hbox{or}\quad a_{n+1}=a_nr \qquad\hbox{for any integer $n\geq 1$} $$

\vskip 2cm
A sequence $a_0,a_1,a_2,\ldots$ is called a {\bf geometric sequence} if, and only if, there is a constant $r$ such that

$$a_k=ra_{k-1}\quad\hbox{for all integers $k\geq 1$}$$

It follows that,

$$a_n=a_0r''\quad\hbox{for all integers $n\geq 0$}$$
