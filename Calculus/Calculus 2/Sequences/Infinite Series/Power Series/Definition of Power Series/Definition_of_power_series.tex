{\bf Definition of Power Series}
\vskip 6pt
If $x$ is a variable, then an infinite series of the form $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+a_3x^3+\ldots+a_nx^n+\ldots$$ is called a {\bf power series}. More generally, an infinite series of the form $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(x-c)^n=a_0+a_1(x-c)+a_2(x-c)^2+\ldots+a_n(x-c)^n+\ldots$$ is called a {\bf power series centered at $c$}, where $c$ is a constant.
