{\bf Guidelines For Finding a Taylor Series}

$1.$ Differentiate $f$ with respect to $x$ serveral times and evaluate each derivative at $c$
$$f(c),f'(c),f''(c),\ldots,f^{(n)}(c),\ldots$$ Try to recognize a pattern in these numbers.

$2.$ Use the sequence developed in the first step to form the Taylor coefficients $a_n={f^{(n)}(c)\over n!}$ and determine the interval of convergence for the resulting power series $$f(c)+f'(c)(x-c)+{f''(c)\over 2!}(x-c)^2+\ldots+{f^{(n)}(c)\over n!}(x-c)^n+\ldots$$
\vskip 1mm
$3.$ Within this interval of convergence, determine whether the series converges to $f(x)$.
