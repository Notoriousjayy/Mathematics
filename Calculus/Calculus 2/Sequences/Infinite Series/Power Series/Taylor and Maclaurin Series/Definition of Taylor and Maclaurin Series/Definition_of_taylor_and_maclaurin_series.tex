{\bf Definition of Taylor and Maclaurin Series}
\vskip 6pt
If a function $f$ has derivatives of all orders at $x=c$, then the series $$\sum_{n=0}^\infty{f^{(c)}(c)\over n!}(x-c)^n=f(c)+f'(c)(x-c)+\ldots+{f^{(n)}(c)\over n!}(x-c)^n+\ldots$$ is called the {\bf Taylor series for $f$ at $c$}. Moreover, if $c=0$, then the series is the {\bf Maclaurin series for $f$}.
