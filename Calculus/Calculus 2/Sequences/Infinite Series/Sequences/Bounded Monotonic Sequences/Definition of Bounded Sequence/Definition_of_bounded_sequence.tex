{\bf Definition of Bounded Sequence}
\vskip 6pt
$1.$ A sequence $(a_n)$ is {\bf bounded above} when there is a real number $M$ such that $a_n \leq M$ for all $n$. The number $M$ is called an {\bf upper bound} of the sequence.
\vskip 2mm
$2.$ A sequence $(a_n)$ is {\bf bounded below} when there is a real number $N$ such that $N \leq a_n$ for all $n$. The number $N$ is called a {\bf lower bound} of the sequence.
\vskip 2mm
$3.$ A sequence $(a_n)$ is {\bf bounded} when it is bounded above and bounded below.
