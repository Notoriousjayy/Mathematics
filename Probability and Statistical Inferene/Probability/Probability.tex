{\bf Probability} 

\vskip 3mm
Probability is a real-values set functon $P$ that assigns, to each event $A$ in the sample space $S$, a number $P(A)$, called the probability off the event $A$, such that the following properties are satisfied:

\vskip 6pt
(a) $P(A)\geq 0$

\vskip 6pt
(b) $P(S)=1$

\vskip 6pt
(c) if $A_1,A_2,A_3,\ldots$ are events and $A_i\cap A_j=\emptyset$, $i\neq j$, then

$$P(A_1\cup A_2\cup\cdots\cup A_k)=P(A_1)+P(A_2)+\cdots+P(A_k)$$

for each positive integer $k$, and

$$P(A_1\cup A_2\cup A_3\cup\cdots)=P(A_1)+P(A_2)+P(A_3)+\cdots$$

for an infinite, but countable, number of events.

{\bf Permutation}

\vskip 6pt
Each of the $n!$ arrangements (in a row) of $n$ different objects is called a permutation of the $n$ objects.

$$n(n-1)\cdots(2)(1)=n!$$

\vskip 3mm
\hrule

\vskip 6pt
{\bf Permutation of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time}

\vskip 1mm
Each of the ${}_nP_r$ arrangmenets is called a permutation of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time.

$${}_nP_r={n(n-1)\cdots(n-r+1)(n-r)\cdots(3)(2)(1)\over (n-r)\cdots(3)(2)(1)}={n!\over (n-r)!}$$

\vskip 3mm
\hrule

\vskip 6pt
{\bf Ordered Sample of Size $r$}

\vskip 1mm
If $r$ objects are selected from a set of $n$ objects, and if the order of selection is noted, then the selected set of $r$ objects is called an ordered sample of size $r$

\vskip 3mm
\hrule

\vskip 6pt
{\bf Sampling with Replacement}

\vskip 1mm
Sampling with replacement occurs when an object is selected and then replaced before the next object is selected.

\vskip 3mm
\hrule

\vskip 6pt
{\bf Sampling without Replacement}

\vskip 1mm
Sampling without replacement occurs when an object is not replaced after it has been selected

$$n(n-1)\cdots(n-r+1)={n!\over (n-r)!}$$

\vskip 3mm
\hrule

\vskip 6pt
{\bf Combination of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time}

\vskip 1mm
Each of the ${}_nC_r$ unordered subsets is called a combination of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time, where

$${}_nC_r={n\choose r}={n!\over r!(n-r)!}$$

\vskip 15mm
{\bf Distinguishable Permutation}

\vskip 1mm
Each of the ${}_nC_r$ permutations of $n$ objects, $r$ of one type and $n-r$ of another type, is called a distinguishable permutation.

\vskip 3mm

\vskip 6pt
{\bf Conditional Probability}

\vskip 1mm
The conditional probability of an event $A$, given that event $B$ has occurred, is defined by

$$P(A|B)={P(A\cap B})\over P(B)$$

provided that $P(B)>0$

\vskip 3mm
\hrule

\vskip 6pt
{\bf Multiplication Rule}

\vskip 1mm
The probability that two events $A$ and $B$, both occur is given by the multiplication rule

$$P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B|A)$$

provided $P(A)>0$ or by

$$P(A\cap B)=P(B)P(A|B)$$

provided $P(B)>0$

\vskip 3mm
\hrule

\vskip 6pt
{\bf Independent Events}

\vskip 1mm
Events $A$ and $B$ are indepednent if and only if $P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)$. Otherwise, $A$ and $B$ are called depdendent events.

\vskip 3mm
\hrule

\vskip 6pt
{\bf Mutually Independent}

Events $A,B$, and $C$ are mutually independent if and only if the following two conditions hold:

\vskip 1mm
(a) $A,b$, and $C$ are pairwise independent; that is

$$P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B_,\quad P(A\cap C)=P(A)P(C)$$

and

$$P(B\cap C)=P(B)P(C)$$

(b) $P(A\cap B\cap C)=P(A)P(B)P(C)$
