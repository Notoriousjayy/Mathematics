{\bf Theorem: 1.1-3}

\vskip 6pt
If events $A$ and $B$ are such that $A\subset B$, then $P(A)\leq P(B)$

\vskip 10pt
{\bf Proof}

\vskip 6pt
Because $A\subset B$, we have

$$B=A\cup (B\cap A')\quad\hbox{and}\quad A\cap(B\cap A')=\emptyset$$

Hence, from property (c) of {\bf probability},

$$P(B)=P(A)+P(B\cap A')\geq P(A)$$

because, from property (a) of {\bf probability},

$$P(B\cap A')\geq 0$$
