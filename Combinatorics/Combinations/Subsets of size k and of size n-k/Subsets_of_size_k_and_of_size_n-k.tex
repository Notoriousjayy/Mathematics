{\bf Subsets of size $k$ and of size $n-k$}
\vskip 6pt

$${n\choose k}={n \choose n-k} \quad\hbox{and}\quad{}_nC_k={}_nC_{n-k}$$

The number of subsets of size $k$ of a set with $n$ objects is the same as the number of subsets of size $n-k$. The number of combinations of $n$ objects taken $k$ at a time is the same as the number of combinations of $n$ objects taken $n-k$ at a time.
