{\bf The Fundamental Counting Principle}
\vskip 6pt

Given a combined action, or {\it event}, in which the first action can be performed in $n_1$ ways, the second action can be performed in $n_2$ ways, and so on. the total number of ways in which the combined action can be performed is the product

$$n_1\cdot n_2 \cdot n_3 \cdot\cdots n_k$$
