{\bf The Number Permutation of $n$ Objects taken $k$ at a Time}
\vskip 6pt

The number of permutations of a set of $n$ objects taken $k$ at a time denoted ${}_nP_k$ is given by

$$\leqalignno{{}_nP_k&= \underbrace{n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots \lbrace n-(k-1)\rbrace}_{k\rm\; factors}&(1)\cr
		&={n!\over (n-k)!} &(2)\cr}$$

For a set of $n$ objects in which $n_1$ are of one kind, $n_2$ are of another kind,$\ldots$, and $n_k$ are of a $k^{th}$ kind, the number of distinguishable permutations is $${n!\over n_1!\cdot n_2!\cdot n_k!}$$
