{\bf Theorem 5.3}
\vskip 6pt
Let $v$ be a cut-vertex in a connected graph $G$ and let $u$ and $w$ be vertices in distinct components of $G-u$. Then $v$ lies on every $u$---$v$ path in $G$.

{\bf Corollary 5.4}
\vskip 6pt
A vertex $v$ of a connected graph $G$ is a cut-vertex of $G$ {\it if and only if} there exists $u$ and $w$ distinct from $v$ such that $v$ lies on every $u$---$w$ path of $G$.
\vskip 10pt
{\bf Proof:}
\vskip 6pt
Suppose that $v$ is a cut-vertex of $G$. Then $G-v$ is disconnected. Let $u$ and $w$ be vertices in different components of $G-v$. It then follows by Theorem 5.3 that every $u$---$w$ path in $G$ contains $v$.
\vskip 1mm
On the other hand, if $G$ contains two vertices $u$ and $w$ such that every $u$---$w$ path in $G$ contains $v$, then there is no $u$---$w$ path in $G-v$. Thus $u$ and $w$ are not connected in $G-v$ and so $G-v$ id disconnected. Therefore, $v$ is a cut-vertex of $G$.
