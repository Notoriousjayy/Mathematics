{\bf Theorem 5.15}
\vskip 6pt
For every two integers $r$ and $n$ with $2 \leq r < n$, $$ \kappa (H_{r,n})=r$$
\vskip 12pt
If $r$ is even or if $r$ is odd and $n$ is even, then $H_{r,n}$ is an $r$--regular graph of order $n$ and so has size $m= {rn \over 2}$. Thus $ \bigl\lfloor {2m \over n} \bigr\rfloor = r$. On the other hand, if $r$ and $n$ are both odd, then $H_{r,n}$ contains $n-1$ vertices of degree $r$ and one vertex of degree $r+1$ and so $m={(rn+1) \over 2}$. In this case as well, $ \bigl\lfloor {2m \over n} \bigr\rfloor = r$ and so by Theorem 5.13 $ \kappa (H_{r,n}) \leq r$. In fact, $\kappa (H_{r,n}) \leq \delta(H_{r,n})=1$.
