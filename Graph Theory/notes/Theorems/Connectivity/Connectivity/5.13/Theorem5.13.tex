{\bf Theorem 5.13}
\vskip 6pt
If $G$ is a graph of order $n$ and size $m \geq n-1$, then $$ \kappa (G) \leq \Biggl\lfloor {2m \over n} \Biggr\rfloor$$

{\bf Proof:}

Since the sum of the degrees of the vertices of $G$ is $2m$, the average degree of the vertices of $G$ is ${2m \over n}$ and so $\delta (G) \leq {2m \over n}$. Since $\delta (G)$ is an integer, $\delta (G) \leq \bigl\lfloor {2m \over n} \bigr\rfloor$. By Theorem 5.11 $\kappa (G) \leq \bigl\lfloor {2m \over n} \bigr\rfloor$
