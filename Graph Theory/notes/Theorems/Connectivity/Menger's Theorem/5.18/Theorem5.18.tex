{\bf Theorem 5.18}
\vskip 6pt
Let $G$ be a $k$-connected graph and let $S$ be any set of $k$ vertices. If a graph $H$ is obtained from $G$ by adding a new vertex $w$ and joining $w$ to the vertices of $S$, then $H$ is also $k$-connected.

{\bf Corollary 5.19}
\vskip 6pt
If $G$ is a $k$-connected graph and $u,v_1,v_2, \ldots , v_k$ are $k+1$ distinct vertices of $G$, then there exists internally disjoint $u$---$v_i$ paths $(1 \leq i \leq k)$ in $G$.
