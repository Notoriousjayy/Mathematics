{\bf Theorem 6.5}
\vskip 6pt
If $G$ is a {\it Hamiltonian graph}, then for every {\it non-empty proper set} $S$ of vertices of $G$, $$k(G-S) \leq |S|$$

{\bf Proof:}
\vskip 6pt
Let $S$ be a non-empty proper subset of $V(G)$. Suppose that $k(G-S)=k$ and that $G_1,G_2, \ldots ,G_k$ are components of $G-S$.
Since $G$ is Hamiltonian, $G$ contains a Hamiltonian cycle $C$. Whenever $C$ encounters a vertex of $G_i$ for the last time $(1 \leq i \leq k)$, the next vertex
of $C$ must belong to $S$. This implies that $S$ must contain at least $k$ vertices, that is, $k=k(G-S) \leq |S|$.
