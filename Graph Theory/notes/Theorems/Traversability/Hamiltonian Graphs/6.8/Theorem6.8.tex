{\bf Theorem 6.8}
\vskip 6pt
Let $u$ and $v$ be {\it non-adjacent vertices} in a graph $G$ of ordern $n$ such that $deg(u)+deg(v) \geq n$. Then $G+uv$ is {\it Hamiltonian}
{\it if and only if} $G$ is {\it Hamiltonian}

{\bf Symbolically:}
\vskip 6pt
Let $u$ and $v$ be {\it non-adjacent vertices} in a graph $G$ of ordern $n$ such that $deg(u)+deg(v) \geq n$. Then $G+uv$ is {\it Hamiltonian}
$\Leftrightarrow$ $G$ is {\it Hamiltonian}

{\bf Proof}
\vskip 6pt
If $G$ is a Hamiltonian graph, then certainly $G+uv$ is Hamiltonian for any non-adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$ of $G$. Thus we need only verify the converse.
\vskip 1mm
Let $G+uv$ be a Hamiltonian graph for two non-adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$ of a graph $G$ and assume, to the contrary, that $G$ is not Hamiltonian. This
implies that every Hamiltonian $u$---$v$ path. Since $deg_Gu+deg_Gv \geq n$, the proof of Theorem 6.6 tells us that $G$ contains a Hamiltonian cycle. This is a contradiction.
