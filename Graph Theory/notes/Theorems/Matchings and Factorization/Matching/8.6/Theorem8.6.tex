{\bf Theorem 8.6}
\vskip 6pt
Every $r$--regular bipartite graph $(r \geq 1)$ has a perfect matching.

{\bf Proof:}
\vskip 6pt
Let $G$ be an $r$--regular bipartite graph with partite sets $U$ and $W$. Necessarily $|U|=|W|$. Let $X$ be a non-empty subset of $U$. Suppose that $|X|=k \geq 1$. Since every vertex of $X$ has degree $r$
in $G$, there are $kr$ edges of $G$ incident with vertices of $X$. Furthermore, since each vertex of $W$ is incident with at most $r$ of these $kr$ edges, every vertex in $N(X)$ is incident with at most $r$
edges and so $|N(X)| \geq k=|X|$. By theorem 8.3, $G$ has a perfect matching.
