Every $3$-regular bridgeless graph contains a $1$-factor.

Let $G$ be a $3$-regular bridgeless graph and let $S$ be a subset of $V(G)$ of cardinality $k \geq 1$. We show that the number $k_o(G-S)$ of odd components of $G-S$ is at most $|S|$. Since this is certainly the case if $G-S$ has no odd components, we may assume that $G-S$ has $\ell \geq 1$ odd components $G_1,G_2, \ldots G_{\ell}$. Let $X_i(1 \leq i \leq \ell)$ denote the set of edges joining the vertices of $S$ and the vertices  of $G_i$. Since every vertex of each graph $G_i$ has degree $3$ in $G$ and the sum of the degrees of the vertices in the graph $G_i$ is even, $|X_i|$ is odd. Because $G$ is bridgeless, $|X_i| \neq 1$ for each $i(1 \leq i \leq \ell$ and so $|X_i| \geq 3$. Therefore, there are at least $3\ell$ edges joining the vertices of $S$ has degree $3$ in $G$, at most $3k$ edges join the vertices of $S$ and the vertices of $G-S$. Therefore, $$3k_o(G-S)=3\ell \leq 3k=3|S|$$ and so $k_o(G-S) \leq |S|$. By Theorem 8.10, $G$ has a $1$-factor.
