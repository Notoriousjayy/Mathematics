The Petersen graph is not $1$-factorable.

{\bf Proof:}

Assume, to the contrary, that the Petersen graph $PG$ is $1$-factorable. Thus $PG$ can be factored into three $1$-factors $F_1,F_2,F_3$. Hence the spanning subgraph $H$ of $PG$ with $E(H)=E(F_1) \cup E(F_2)$ is $2$-regular and so $H$ is either a single cycle or a union of two or more cycles. Since $PG$ is not Hamiltonian, $H$ cannot be a single cycle and is therefore the union of two or more cycles. On the other hand, since the length of a smallest cycle in $PG$ is $5$, it follows that $H=2C_5$. This is impossible, however, since $2C_5$ does not contain a $1$-factor.
