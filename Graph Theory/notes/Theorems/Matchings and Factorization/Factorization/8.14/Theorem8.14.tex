{\bf Theorem 8.14}
\vskip 6pt
For each positive integer $k$m the complete graph $K_{2k}$ is $1$-factorable.

{\bf Proof:}

Since the result is true for $k=1$ and $k=2$, we assume that $k \geq 3$. Let $G=K_{2k}$, where $V(G)= \lbrace v_0,v_1,v_2 \ldots v_{2k-1} \rbrace$. Let $v_0,v_1,v_2 \ldots v_{2k-1}$ be the vertices of a regular $(2k-1)$-gon and place $v_0$ in the center of the $(2k-1)$-gon. Draw each edge of $G$ as a straight line segment. Let $F_1$ be the $1$-factor of $G$ consisting of the edge $v_0v_1$ and all edges of $G$ perpendicular to $v_0v_1$, namely $v_2v_{2k-1},v_3v_{2k-2}, \ldots ,v_kv_{k+1}$. In general, for $1 \leq i \leq 2k-1$ let $F_i$ be the $1$-factor of $G$ consisting of the edge $v_0v_i$ and all edges of $G$ perpendicular to $v_0v_i$. Then $G$ has a factorization into the $1$-factors $F_1,F_2, \ldots ,F_{2k-1}$.
