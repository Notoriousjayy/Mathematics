{\bf Theorem 8.15}
\vskip 6pt
Every $r$-regular bipartite graph, $r \geq 1$, is $1$-factorable.

{\bf Proof:}
\vskip 6pt
Let $G$ be an $r$-regular bipartite graph, where $r \geq 1$. By Theorem 8.6, $G$ contains a perfect matching $M_1$. Hence $G-M_1$ is $(r-1)$-regular. If $r \geq 2$, then $G-M_1$ contains a perfect matchin $M_2$. Containing in this manner and applying Theorem 8.6 $r$ times, we see that $E(G)$ can be partitioned into perfect matchings, which gives rise to a $1$-factorization of $G$.
