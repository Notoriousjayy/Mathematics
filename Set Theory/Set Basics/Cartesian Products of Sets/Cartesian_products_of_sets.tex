$\bullet$ {\bf ordered pair} $(x,y)$ order matters. $$(x,y)\neq (y,x)$$

The ordered pair $(x,y)$ is a single element consisting of a pair of elements in which $x$ is the first element (or first coordinate) of the ordered pair and $y$ is the second element (or second coordinate)

$\bullet$ The {\bf Cartesian product} of $A\times B$  of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set consisting of all ordered pairs whose first coordinate belongs to $A$ and whose second coordinate belongs to $B$.
