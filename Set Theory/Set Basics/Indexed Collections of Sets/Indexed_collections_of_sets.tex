$\bullet$ The {\bf union} of the $n\geq 2$ sets $A_1,A_2,\ldots A_n$ is denoted by $A_1\cup A_2 \cup \ldots A_n$ or $\bigcup_{i=1}^nA_i$ and is defined as $$\bigcup_{i=1}^nA_i=\lbrace x: x\in A_i \qquad\hbox{for some $i$, $1\leq i \leq n$}\qquad\rbrace$$

$\bullet$ The {\bf intersection} of the $n\geq 2$ sets $A_1,A_2,\ldots A_n$ is denoted by $A_1\cap A_2 \cap \ldots A_n$ or $\bigcap_{i=1}^nA_i$ and is defined as $$\bigcap_{i=1}^nA_i=\lbrace x: x\in A_i \qquad\hbox{for some $i$, $1\leq i \leq n$}\qquad\rbrace$$

$\bullet$ An {\bf index set} $I$ is a non-empty set used to describe conviently the union or intersection of a collection of sets that cannot be described conviently.
