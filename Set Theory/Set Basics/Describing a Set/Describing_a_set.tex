{\bf Describing a Set}

$\bullet$ A {\bf set} is a collection of objects.
\vskip 1pc

$\bullet$ The objects that make up a set are called its {\bf elements} or {\bf members}.
\vskip 1pc

$\bullet$ We denote sets with captial letters (such as $A,B,C,\ldots,Z$) and lower-case letters denote elements (such as $a,b,c,\ldots,z$) of sets. If $a$ is an element of set $A$, then we write $a\in A$, if $a$ is not in $A$ we write $a\not\in A$
\vskip 1pc

$\bullet$ The set that contains no elements is the {\bf empty set}(or sometimes called the {\bf null set} or {\bf void set}).
\vskip 1pc

$\bullet$ The empty set is denoted $\emptyset$.
\vskip 1pc

$\bullet$ We can also write $\emptyset=\lbrace \rbrace$
\vskip 1pc

$\bullet$ We use {\bf $N$} to denote the set of all {\bf positive integers} or {\bf real numbers}. That is $$N=\lbrace 1, 2, 3,\ldots\rbrace$$

$\bullet$ The set of all integers is denoted by $Z$ $$Z=\lbrace\ldots , -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\rbrace$$

$\bullet$ The set of {\bf real numbers} is denoted $R$ and the set of positive real number is denoted by $R^+$.
\vskip 1pc

$\bullet$ A real number that can be expressed in the form ${m\over n}$, where $m,n\in Z$ and $n\neq 0$, is called a {\bf rational number}.
\vskip 1mm

The set of all rational numbers is denoted {\bf Q}.
\vskip 1pc

$\bullet$ A real number that is not rational is called {\bf irrational}.
\vskip 1mm

$\bullet$ The set of all irrational numbers is denoted $I$
\vskip 1pc

$\bullet$ The number $|S|$ is denotes the number of elements in set $S$
\vskip 1pc

$\bullet$ A set is {\bf finite} if $|S|=n$ for some non-negative integer $n$
\vskip 1pc

$\bullet$ A set is {\bf infinite} if it is not finite.
\vskip 1pc

$\bullet$ A {\bf complex number} is a number of the form $a+bi$, where $a,b\in R$ and $\sqrt{i}$
