$\bullet$ The {\bf union} of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A\cup B$, is the set of all elements belonging to $A$ or $B$ $$A\cup B=\lbrace x: x\in A \quad\hbox{or } x\in B\rbrace$$

$\bullet$ The {\bf intersection} of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A\cap B$, is the set of all elements belonging to both $A$ and $B$ $$A\cap B=\lbrace x: x\in A \quad\hbox{and } x\in B\rbrace$$

$\bullet$ If two sets $A$ and $B$ have no elements in common, then $A\cap B=\emptyset$ and $A$ and $B$ are said to be {\bf disjoint}.

$\bullet$ The {\bf difference} $A-B$ of two sets $A$ and $B$ is defined as $$A-B=\lbrace x: x\in A \quad\hbox{and } x\not\in B\rbrace$$

$\bullet$ For a set $A$, its {\bf complement} is $${\bar A}=U-A=\lbrace x:x\in U \quad\hbox{and } x\not\in A \rbrace$$

$\bullet$ The set difference $A-B$ is sometimes called the {\bf relative complement} of $B$ in $A$.
