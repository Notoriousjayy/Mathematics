{\bf Explicit Solution}: A function $\phi(x)$ that when substituted for $y$ satisfies the equation for all $x$ in the interval $I$ is called the {\bf explicit solution} to the equation $I$.

\vskip 6pt
{\bf Implicit Solution}: A relation $G(x,y)=0$ is said to be an {\bf implicit solution} on the interval $I$ if it defines one or more explicit solutions on $I$.

\vskip 6pt
The general for of an $n^{th}$-order equation with $x$ independent, $y$ dependent, can be expressed as

$$F\Biggl(x,y,{dy\over dx},\ldots, {d^ny\over dx^n}\Biggr)=0$$

\vskip 6pt
Where $F$ is a function that depends on $x,y,$ and the other derivatives of $y$ up to order $n$. We assume that the equation holds for all $x$ in an open Interval $I(a<x<b)$. In many cases we can isolate the highest-order term $d^ny/dx^n$ and write the equation as

$${d^ny\over dx^n}=f\biggl(x,y,{dy\over dx},\ldots,{d^{n-1}y\over dx^{n-1}}\Biggr)$$

\vskip 6pt
Which is often preferable for theoretical and computational purposes.

\vskip 6pt
{\bf Initial Value Problem}: By an {\bf initial value problem} for an $n^{th}$-order differential equation

$$F\Biggl(x,y,{dy\over dx},\ldots, {d^ny\over dx^n}\Biggr)=0$$

we mean: Find a solution to the differential equation on an interval $I$ that satisfies at $x_0$ the $n$ initial conditions

$$\eqalign{y(x_0)&= y_0,\cr
	{dy\over dx}(x_0)&=y_1, \cr
	\vdots\cr
	{d^{n-1}y\over dx^{n-1}}(x_0)&=y_{n-1}\cr}$$

where $x_0 \in I$ and $y_0, y_1,\ldots, y_{n-1}$ are given constants.

{\bf Theorem: Existence and Uniqueness of Solution}

\vskip 6pt
Consider the inital value problem

$${dy\over dx}=f(x,y),\quad y(x_0)=y_0$$

If $f$ and $\partial f/ \partial y$ are continuous in some rectangle

$$R=\lbrace(x,y): a<x<b,\;c<y<d\rbrace$$

that contains the point $(x_0,y_0)$, then the initial value problem has aunique solution $\phi(x)$ in some interval $x_0-\delta<x<x_0+\delta$ is a positive number.
