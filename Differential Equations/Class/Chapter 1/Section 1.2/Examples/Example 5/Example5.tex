{\bf Example 5:} Verify that for every constant $C$ the relation $4x^2-y^2=C$ is an implicit solution to

$$y{dy\over dx}-4x=0$$

{\bf Solution}

\vskip 6pt
When we implicitly differentiate the equation $4x^2-y^2=C$ with respect to $x$, we find

$$8x-2y{dy\over dx}=0$$

which is equivalent to $y{dy\over dx}-4x=0$.If we sketched the implict solution for $C=0,\pm 1,\pm 4$. The curves are hyperbolas with common asymptotes $y=\pm 2x$. Notice that the implicit solution curves (with $C$ arbitrary) fill the entire plane and are nonintersecting for $C\neq 0$. For $C=0$, the implicit solution gives rise to the two explicit solutions $y=2x$ and $y=-2x$, both of which pass through the origin.
