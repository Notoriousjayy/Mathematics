{\bf Substitution Procedure}: 

\vskip 6pt
(a) Identify the type of equation and determine the appropriate substitution or tranformation.

\vskip 6pt
(b) Rewrite the original equation in terms of new variables.

\vskip 6pt
(c) Solve the transformed equation.

\vskip 6pt
(d) Express the solution in terms of the original variables.

\vskip 6pt
If the right-hand side of the equation

$${dy\over dx}=f(x,y)$$

can be expressed as a function of the ration ${y\over x}$ alone, then we say the equation is {\bf homogeneous}.
