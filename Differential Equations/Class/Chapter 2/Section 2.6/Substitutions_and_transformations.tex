{\bf Substitutions and Transformations}: 

\vskip 6pt

\vskip 6pt
(a) Identify the type of equation and determine the appropriate substitution or tranformation.

\vskip 6pt
(b) Rewrite the original equation in terms of new variables.

\vskip 6pt
(c) Solve the transformed equation.

\vskip 6pt
(d) Express the solution in terms of the original variables.

{\bf Definition of Homogeneous Equation}: 

\vskip 6pt
If the right-hand side of the equation

$${dy\over dx}=f(x,y)$$

can be expressed as a function of the ration ${y\over x}$ alone, then we say the equation is {\bf homogeneous}.

{\bf Definition of Bernoulli Equation}
\vskip 6pt
A first-order equation that can be written in the form

$${dy\over dx}+P(x)y=Q(x)y^n$$

where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are continuous on an interval $(a,b)$ and $n$ is a real number, is called a {\bf Bernoulli equation}.
