{\bf Example 3:} Solve the nonlinear equation

$${dy\over dx}={6x^5-2x+1\over \cos(y)+e^y}$$

{\bf Solution}

\vskip 6pt
Separating variables and integrating, we have

$$\eqalign{\bigl(\cos(y)+e^y\bigr)dy&=\bigl(6x^5-2x+1\bigr)dx\cr
	\int\bigl(\cos(y)+e^y\bigr)dy&=\int\bigl(6x^5-2x+1\bigr)dx\cr
	\sin(y)+e^y&=x^6-x^2+x+C}$$

At this point, we reach an impasse. We would like to solve for $y$ explicitly, but we cannot. That is often the case in solving nonlinear first-order equations. Consequently, when we say "solve the equation," we must on occasion be content if only an implicit form of the solution has been found.
