{\bf Example 1:} Solve the nonlinear equation

$${dy\over dx}={x-5\over y^2}$$

{\bf Solution}

\vskip 6pt
Following the streamlined approach, we separate the variables and rewrite the equation in the form

$$y^2dy=(x-5)dx$$

Integrating, we have

$$\eqalign{\int y^2dy&=\int (x-5)dx\cr
	{y^3\over 3} &={x^2\over 2}-5x+C\cr}$$

and solving this last equation for $y$ gives

$$y=\biggl({3x^2\over 2}-15x+3C\biggr)^{1\over 3}$$

Since $C$ is a constant of integration that can be any real number, $3C$ can also be any real number. Replacing $3C$ by the single symbol $C$, we have

$$y=\biggl({3x^2\over 2}-15x+C\biggr)^{1\over 3}$$
