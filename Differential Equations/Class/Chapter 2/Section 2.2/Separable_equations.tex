{\bf Separable Equation}: If the right-hand side of the equation

$${dy\over dx}=f(x,y)$$

can be expressed as a function $g(x)$ that depends only on $x$ times a function $p(y)$ that depends only on $y$, then the differential equation is called {\bf separable}. In other words, a first-order equation is separable if it can be written in the form

$${dy\over dx}=g(x)p(y)$$

To solve the equation
$${dy\over dx}=g(x)p(y)$$

multiply by $dx$ and by $h(y)\equiv 1/p(y)$ to obtain

$$h(y)dy=g(x)dx$$

Then integrate both sides:

$$\eqalign{\int h(y)dy&=\int g(x)dx\cr
		H(y)&=G(x)+C \cr}$$

where we have merged the two constants of integration into a single symbol C. The last equation gives an implicit solution to the differential equation.
